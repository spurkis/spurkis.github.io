I'm passionate about complex systems, strategy, technology and society.  I help organisations
improve their situational awareness and decide what to do, often with the aid of
[Wardley Maps](https://medium.com/wardleymaps).  I also help make software delivery
teams better.

I speak at events on occasion, and publish free talks on {{<icon class="slideshare">}}
[Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/spurkis/).  I'm an advocate of Open Source Software
and former [Perl contributor](https://metacpan.org/author/SPURKIS).

When I'm not working I'm either busy being a parent, exploring the outdoors, or trying to
avoid rebuilding another house.  I also make music from time to time, my most memorable
band was [detwiije](http://www.myspace.com/detwiije).
